# MySqlConnectorWrappers

This repository holds 2 wrappers for 2 of the most popular MySql Connectors:
[MySql.Data by MySql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MySql.Data/)
[MySqlConnector by bgrainer & MySqlConnector](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MySqlConnector/)

Each wrapper makes creating products that require on MySql simpler, as most of the code that is copied and pasted is changed to either object instantiation, or single method calls.

Both of these have the same use, so read about how to use either library in the [wiki](https://github.com/Pustalorc/MySqlConnectorWrapper/wiki).
